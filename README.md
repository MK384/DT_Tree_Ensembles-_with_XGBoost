# DT_Tree_Ensembles-_with_XGBoost
### This is an educational Machine Learning project. It's a full implementation from scratch of classifier and regressor decision tree built with support for Tree Ensembles.
### the algorithm used for the tree ensembles is the xgboost algorithm. several tests and analysis has been made on the model using three datasets from kaggle which thier links are below.
- The implementaion if fully documented and commented for erase of understanding the code and modification.
- The module has been distributed as two packages.
- One package is for special purposes and the seconds package depends on.
- The second package is the main module that contain the APIs for trainging and and testing the model.
- Although the second package (dt_xgboost) is main one that contains the algorithm, the first one contains good helper functions may be used for building another ensembles algorighms.
- The user has to feel free to use the module for any kind of purposes even with commercial ones with mention the source.
- the modification are allowed two.
